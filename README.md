# CONTRAD: The Evaluation of Dengue Cases in the Philippines from 2008 to 2016
# INTRODUCTION
Dengue viruses are spread to people through the bite of an infected species of mosquito which is called the Aedes. Almost half of the worldâ€™s population, including the Philippines, live in areas with a risk of dengue. Dengue is often a leading cause of illness in areas with risk, such as in stocked water that is unused, rain water that had not been discarded immediately. Dengue outbreaks are occurring in many places in the Philippines especially in rural areas. 

How can you prevent the occurrence of dengue in your place? Here are some tips. Protect yourself from mosquito bites. Discard waters that has mosquito eggs in it. Buy devices or products that can kill or reduce mosquitos (e.g. mosquito coil, mosquito killer lamp, electric mosquito racket, insect or mosquito repellent, etc.)

A person can be infected with a dengue virus as many as four times in his or her lifetime. There are a few research stated that there is a new dengue vaccine that is approved for use in children aged 9 to 16 years with laboratory-confirmed previous dengue virus infection and living in areas where dengue is endemic.

The final dengue fever numbers for 2021 have been released by the Philippines Department of Health and the number of total cases were 12 percent lower than what was reported in 2020. From Jan. 1 to Dec. 31, 2021, there were a total of 79,872 dengue cases with 285 deaths (CFR 0.4%) reported. This compares to the 90,135 cases and 324 deaths reported in the same period in 2020.

# STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM
Dengue fever is one of the Philippines' most serious health problems. Dengue fever incidences have been on the rise in the Philippines in recent years. Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne disease that spreads to other mosquito species after the dengue virus has been infected. There is no available  vaccine for patients suffering from dengue fever in this country. As a result, avoiding the disease's potential causes is the best method to prevent it from spreading further. Dengue fever can only be solved or controlled by reducing the Aedes population. To reduce the presence of Aedes, it is critical to be aware of their habitats ahead of time.

# SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PROJECT
This project is significant to the following:

Local Government Unit (LGU)  

This will assist them in analyzing and determining the precise locations and ages that are most targeted by Dengue in their areas. It will also improve their reaction and prompt them to implement measures to prevent dengue cases in local barangays and municipalities. Create initiatives with the assistance of the national government and even the Department of Health (DOH).

Students  

This would enable students to gain insights into their current health and take efforts as leaders in their schools and communities. It can force them to educate and guide minorities in cleaning their surroundings in order to prevent dengue cases in both private and public locations such as schools, parks, and even residences. This data will demonstrate that even a clean community can be impacted if its surroundings are not clean and orderly. This will teach them to appreciate nature.

Parents and Guardians  

This would teach parents and guardians to help their family stay safe by assisting LGUs in taking care of their environment and establishing collaboration with their respective leaders of their local barangays and towns. As parents, the correct safety of their children's health should be their priority and obligation.

# METHODS
A data extraction instrument developed as a series of Excel (CSV) spreadsheets was used to collate and summarize the selected data sources. Data were extracted into spreadsheets for analysis based on the following categories: month, year, region, and number of dengue cases. Data from previously published peer-reviewed studies and pre-2000 data published during the search period were not extracted. The original data sources and extraction tables were made available to all members of the Literature Review Group for review and analysis.

# EXPECTED OUTPUT
Effective vector control measures are critical to achieving and sustaining reduction of morbidity attributable to dengue. Preventive and vector control interventions aim to reduce dengue transmission, thereby decreasing the incidence of the infection and preventing outbreaks of the disease.

The mosquito Aedes aegypti is the primary vector of dengue. It has evolved to mate, feed, rest and lay eggs in and around urban human habitation. Aedes aegypti is a daytime feeder; its peak biting periods are early in the morning and before dusk in the evening. Female Aedes aegypti frequently bites multiple people during each feeding period. 

The availability of a safe, efficacious and cost-effective vaccine would significantly alter the concept for dengue prevention. As the global spread of dengue persists, vaccine development has received increasing interest and support by researchers, vaccine manufacturers, policy-makers and funding agencies. But as has been repeatedly demonstrated, even a perfect vaccine is only as good as our ability to deliver it. Planning for the most effective implementation of vaccine delivery is a technical element that should begin to be addressed now.
